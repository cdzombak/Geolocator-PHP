# Geolocator-PHP #
Geolocator is a PHP class which provides an easy-to-use interface to the IP Address Location XML API described at [ipinfodb.com](http://ipinfodb.com/ip_location_api.php). This API allows you to find the city, state/region, country, and approximate latitude/longitude associated with an IP address or domain.

The class aims to be easy-to-use, versatile, and well-documented. It requires PHP 5.30 or greater, compiled with cURL support.
