# Geolocator-PHP #

Geolocator provides an easy-to-use, versatile, object-oriented interface to the IP Location API provided by [ipinfodb.com](http://ipinfodb.com/ip_location_api.php). This API allows you to find the city, state/region, country, and approximate latitude/longitude associated with an IP address or domain.

It requires PHP [5.3.0](http://php.net/releases/5_3_0.php) or greater, with [cURL](http://php.net/manual/en/book.curl.php) and [JSON](http://php.net/manual/en/book.json.php) support. (It may work with less than v5.3.0, but this is not supported.)

## Current Versions

The current and development versions [are maintained on Github](http://github.com/cdzombak/Geolocator-PHP).

There is not currently a stable working version. v3 is currently in development and is stable enough for development.
