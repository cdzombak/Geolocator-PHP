TODO:

* 2.0-ALPHA-3: Get rid of 25-lookup limitation; do multiple reqs as necessary
* 2.0-ALPHA-3: Do not require that constructor take an argument
* 2.0-ALPHA-3: Allow getLocation() to auto-add to $ips as well

* 2.0-BETA: Unbreak 1.x compatibility
* 2.0-BETA: implement ArrayObject sort functions?
* 2.0-BETA: implement exchangeArray, getArrayCopy ?
* 2.0-BETA: Make sure array pointer for ips can't get corrupted/moved around unintentionally
* 2.0-BETA: better tests, esp. of iterator function
* 2.0-BETA: Consider using phpDocumentor for docs. This looks like it'll be painful on Windows, so I'll need
  to get it set up in a *nix environment.
  
* 2.1: Better lookup methods for efficiency (only do what we need first, then do the rest?)
